## ALX-Portfolio-Project

* I've come to the end of my ALX SWE program, I've had bad times and good times, tough times for the most part.
  As a result, I am dedicating this project to MYSELF by representing myself in the best way possible, to demonstrate
  the skills I have acquired ever since joining ALX 13 months go (Was supposed to be 12 but the basic shell project toppled me over terribly, I AM STILL traumatized :'[ ... )

This project contains a lot of the frontend technologies because it was intended to be User Experience oriented but it does incoporate subtle backend tecnlogies to serve my needs.

It was built heavily on React, CSS and HTML. JavaScript really does wonders for the frontend. It also connects to a weather API.

It also relied heavily on Django and PostgreSQL, because I have a Service Request form that will help me keep track of users that are intersted in my services.

It has been a great experience with a lot of challenges but you can't have stayed in ALX SWE for this long and still think about challenges... it is a way of life. We love and go after challenges with a lot of pride after all the torture we've been through.

Pretty sure I'll expand this README.md laterm, but for now... it should do.
